Check out these instructors and their platforms to learn the skills you need.

1. Brad Traversy - The man is a legend. He was my very first introduction to coding with his hour long HTML Crash Course followed by his CSS and Javascript crash courses. I don't know where I would be without his work. He is also an extremely down to earth fellow.

    Both his free content on youtube as well as his Udemy courses are priceless.
